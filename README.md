# AppsAndCopesInternetAddictionResearchPaper
Apps and Copes: Predicting Adolescent and Adult Internet Addiction is a statistical research paper I created in fall 2020, the first semester in which I began taking classes to fulfill my statistics major. 

In hindsight, the methods I used are quite elementary (simply multiple linear regression), but the process of approaching my first data set, running models, and synthesizing a 40-page research paper really helped me grow in confidence as a statistics student. 

I have included the raw dataset I used, and the paper itself in  which I used Minitab for the multiple regression analyses and visualizations. 

In this project, I examined which predictors relating to different Internet applications (e.g., social media, video games, online sexual activity) and coping response (e.g., detached coping, emotional coping) are significant in predicting Internet addiction score, and how these  compare between four age groups: adolescents, young adults, mid adults, and late adults. 

Using stepwise selection to generate 9 predictive multiple regression models, I found many different significant predictors that had varying relationships with the response, suggesting that Internet addiction triggers manifest differently across age groups, and that these individual differences should be taken in account when considering diagnosis, treatment, and intervention strategies for this growing public health threat.
